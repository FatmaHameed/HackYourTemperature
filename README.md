# hackyourweather App

Hack your Weather is a React app using open weather API to fetch the data.

So the user can input the name of the city to fetch the weather information in this city. It shows the name of the city and country, weather description, maximum and minimum temperature in this city as well as the location of the city on longitude and latitute. In case an error occurs due to incorrect city name or other error, this shows in the project, too.

The project is coded using react components. Each component is seperated in different file.
